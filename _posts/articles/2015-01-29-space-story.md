## BEGIN STORY NOTES

There is a civil war between Earth and Mars. Ever since the mineral deposit/gold/STEM CELL finding on mars, every Martian became rich overnight. earth has been trying to unify their economy with Mars. Originally it was an Earth colony but Mars gained independence years ago.

The main character is a blue collar miner on the moon.  120 years ago the shoemaker coment hit the moon giving it a ring of iron. Earth has been harvesting this iron and has catching stations in Gulf of Mexico, Japan, Caspian Sea, Austrailia and Ireland.

After drolling through another day, the main character gets a signal from martian intelligence that he has to destory a comm station on mars. He is conflicted because he has made so many friends and relationships while on his blue collar job for so long.

In the end he ends up hijacking a freighter ship to escape and blows up the comm station, knowing that his friends will survive but he has more or less doomed their families in order to save his.

The story ends as he sees the martian fleet overtake the horizon over the moon as he escapes.

Characters:

Tully - main character, half martian half earthling, sleeper agent for Martian special operations.

Chris - Tully's friend who works with the Moonrakers.

## END STORY NOTES

"G-O-M 29.253839, -94.775666." The rules were that you had to say the coordinates out loud when you punched them in. The 5-ton foil-wrapped bag of silicon dust flung away from the staging frame in an arc towards Earth. Suddenly, a low beeping sound caught Tully's attention.

His heart sank. Tully gulped as he reached over to turn his wrist beacon off. It was a small inconspicous thing that all humans wore. He had been in the middle of harvesting this afternoon's load when it received the signal. While going through the workers' common area he had noticed the holoviewers reporting of renewed tensions over Martian gold. It was only after a matter time after the rumors had started that he knew he'd be getting the call.

His training back on Mars seemed like a hazy fog in his mind. He had been selected specifically for his full-travel status, given his martian father and earthling mother. He quickly rose among his peers at the Martian Academy of Espionage Science. When he had started his mission everything was so clear in his mind: Earthlings are greedy callous people and all we're doing is preventing the inevitable strike on Mars. Martians are the benefactors of Martian gold. Now though, it was all too murky.

Tully slowly landed his rakermech at service bay 16 alongside Base Apollo. "Sabotage the Apollo communications grid" kept passing in front of his head like a marquee. He remembered snarkily thinking there was no question what his cell's next mission was about. Now that he was here in the moment, it felt almost wrong. In previous missions, all he had to do was wait in some rented out house in Jagoff, Nowhere USA and boost up relays to some satellite that was about to burn up.

"No, this is different," he thought as he leaped out of his mech, "I came here among these simple mining people and they accepted me into their homes." Memories of his friend Chris teaching him the idiosyncricies of a rakermech, things his training officiers could never teach him
