#Hi!

My name is John Robert and I'm a creative type that's been living in New York City for 10 years. I perform improv comedy with my team [Thank You, Robot](http://www.thankyourobot.net/), write stuff on the Internet and do comedy related things all over NYC. I live in Manhattan with amazing girlfriend [Crystal Beth](http://thecrystalbeth.com/).
